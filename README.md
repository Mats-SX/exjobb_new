This project is the basis of the Master's Thesis performed by me, MR, during the fall of 2013. It is an implementation of a family of algorithms based on the Fast Zeta Transform. The fundamental value of this family of algorithms comes from the scientific research described in the paper Covering and Packing in Linear Space. This paper describes how to perform the Fast Zeta Transform over a set family in Linear Space, which is an improvement from the general FZT which uses exponential space.

The programs implemented in this project will be able to solve k-covering, k-partitioning and k-packing in linear space and exponential time. Programs to compute the chromatic polynomial of a graph, an essential metric in the problem of graph colouring, will also be implemented, running in exponential time and space, but using far less space than other algorithms of this class
